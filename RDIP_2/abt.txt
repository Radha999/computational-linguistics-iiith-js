This text file is about the 5th experiment.
In this experiment, we need to use the POS tagger. After selecting a sentence from a drop down menu, a table is displayed which is populated with the words belonging to the respective sentence.
Then, in the second column of this table, we  get to pick the parts of speech for that particular word. Ther is a drop down menu for this. When we click the submit button our answers are verified using the POS tagger, which we need to install and incorporate in our js file using js.require library. This tagger helps in finding out the POS of each and every word in the selected sentence. If any of our answers are wrong, we can verify the correct answers by clicking a button. This button displays the 4th column of the table, which gives the correct answers. This is the gist of this experiment. The whole thing should be coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The first column(heading as Lexicon) is populated with the selected sentence, the second column(heading POS) contains a dropdown that is populated with multiple POS tags and this dropdown can be seen for as many rows as there in the first column. The default dropdown value for all dropdowns should be Noun. The third and fourth columns are for now empty.
 You can choose from the dropdowns and whenever you think you have made the choice of the correct POS tags, you can click Submit and the third column now becomes populated with a tick or a cross pertaining to whether the choice you made in the dropdown and the actual correct POS tag match or not.
