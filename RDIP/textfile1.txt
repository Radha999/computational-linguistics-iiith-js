In this experiment we need to create a small table as a part of UI.
The table consists of 2 rows and 2 columns.
We need to enter number of tokens and types in these.
Number of tokens is the total number of words in the given corpus.
Types is the number of unique words.
In this experiment we have 3 corpuses. We need to select one from the drop-down menu.
Then that particular corpus appears on the screen.
From that particular corpus we need to know the number of tokens and types.
#new-types : Words having the same root are considered to be asingle word. So it wouldn't be a new type despite being a new word
For doing this we need to use a snowball stemmer. We should install it.
